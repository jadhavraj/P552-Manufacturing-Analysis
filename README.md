# P522 Manufacturing Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze manufacturing data extracted from SAP to identify trends, patterns, and insights to improve overall manufacturing efficiency and quality. The analysis is conducted using a combination of tools:

* **Data Analysis:** SQL
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau, Excel

## Data Source

The primary data source for this project is SAP, a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. Data is extracted from SAP using various methods, including direct database queries, data exports, or integration with data warehousing tools.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. **Data Extraction:** Extract relevant data from SAP, such as production orders, material consumption, machine downtime, and quality inspection records.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Clean the extracted data to remove inconsistencies, errors, and missing values. This may involve tasks like handling missing data, standardizing data formats, and correcting data inconsistencies.
3. **Data Transformation:** Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis. This may involve creating new variables, aggregating data, and filtering data to focus on specific areas of interest.

## Data Analysis

* **SQL Analysis:** Utilize SQL queries to analyze the extracted data and identify key trends and patterns. This may involve analyzing production volumes, machine utilization, and quality metrics.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Employ statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify significant relationships between variables. This may involve hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression analysis.

## Data Visualization
